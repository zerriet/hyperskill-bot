Simple Chatty bot from HyperSkill's introdcution to Java track

This simple bot is one of the many projects from HyperSkill's introduction to Java track while I try to brush up my fundamentals for microservices role at OCBC.
The bot can take user input and do the following:
  - repeat user's name
  - guess age based on a formula that takes the remainders of the user's age divided by 3, 5, and 7.
  - count from 0 to a number input by the user
  - Produce a simple multiple-choice question and prompts the user for the correct answer, looping the user if he enters incorrectly
